# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Encoding Safety

- Avoid round-tripping UTF-8 source files through PowerShell `Get-Content` / `Set-Content`, especially for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.md`, and Portuguese copy with accents. On this machine that can turn `você` into `vocÃª` and `à` into `Ã `.
- Prefer `apply_patch` for manual edits. For scripted rewrites, use .NET file APIs with explicit UTF-8 read/write settings instead of `Get-Content` / `Set-Content`.

# GitHub PR Linking

When creating a GitHub PR, explicitly state which issue it closes in the PR description so GitHub links it automatically.
Put the closing keyword in the PR description/body, not just in a comment.

Use one of these formats:
- `Closes #123`
- `Fixes #123`
- `Resolves #123`
- `Closes owner/repo#123` for an issue in another repository

If a PR closes multiple issues, repeat the keyword for each issue, for example: `Closes #123, closes #456`.

GitHub documents that automatic linking/closing keywords are interpreted when the PR targets the repository's default branch.

# Streamer.bot Integration

This platform is integrated with Streamer.bot, and many features may depend on Streamer.bot actions, triggers, variables, or other configuration.

When working on features that touch this integration, agents should:
- Assume Streamer.bot configuration may be required for the feature to work correctly.
- Check the up-to-date Streamer.bot documentation before giving setup instructions, because Streamer.bot behavior and configuration steps may change over time.
- Guide the user on the required Streamer.bot setup so the application and Streamer.bot are configured to work together correctly.

# Branch Hygiene

Before creating a new branch, always update the local code from the remote base branch first, usually `master` or the repository default branch, so the branch starts from the latest state.
